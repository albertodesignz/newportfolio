# 👋 Hi, I'm Albert Vargas

**Principal UX & AI Experience Designer**  | Creative Technologist | Systems Thinker


## 🚧 This Is a Personal Space
This GitHub is where I experiment, explore, and build — outside the constraints of enterprise pipelines and corporate silos. It's not polished client work. It's not about hype. It's about curiosity, friction, and invention.

Here, you'll find:
- 🧪 Prototypes, POCs, and AI/UX experiments
- 🧠 Emerging frameworks for ethical and assistive tech
- 🛠️ Tools I'm building for neurodivergent users, advocates, and designers
- ⚙️ Infrastructure for UXDevOps — where UX, code, and systems meet

## ⚡ Fast Facts
- 🛠️ Toolmaker, not just a tool user  
- 🐛 Allergic to buzzwords and "dark mode for everything"  
- 🎯 Believer in human-centered AI  
- 🧩 Building toward explainable, inclusive, and resilient systems

## 💼 Current Work
I'm currently working as a **Principal UX & AI Experience Designer** at **LexisNexis Risk Soluions**, where I lead design initiatives with A.I. and big data across the insurance, healthcare, government and financial industries.

## 🦋A.I.dvocate, Founder

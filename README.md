## 🚧 This Is a Personal Space

This GitHub is where I experiment, explore, and build — outside the constraints of enterprise pipelines and corporate silos. It's not polished client work. It's not about hype. It's about curiosity, friction, and invention.

Here, you'll find:
- 🧪 Prototypes, POCs, and AI/UX experiments
- 🧠 Emerging frameworks for ethical and assistive tech
- 🛠️ Tools I'm building for neurodivergent users, advocates, and designers
- ⚙️ Infrastructure for UXDevOps — where UX, code, and systems meet

## 🦋 About A.I.dvocate

I founded **A.I.dvocate** to rethink how AI can support people who are often underserved by mainstream tech — especially parents of disabled children, neurodivergent users, and frontline community responders.

Some ongoing projects:
- **Mirror Match** – an emotional recognition game built for the neurodiverse community
- **CommuniSense** – social signal intelligence for real-time crisis awareness
- **The Dorkinator** – plain language → Google dork converter for OSINT and investigations
- **UXDevOps Tools** – component pipelines from Axure/Figma to dev-ready handoff via Storybook

If it sounds like a weird mix, that's intentional. Design isn't just about screens — it's about systems, semantics, and service.
